The process of recognising is using the **Tensorflow**  framework to infer the class in which a person belongs to and is using a MobileNet type of CNN *(Convolutional Neural Network)* called **MobileNet_V1** that can be retrained using transfer learning to the desired outcome.

This system has two parts:
* A central application that is used for controling and configuring
* A remote applcation that can be deployed in the desired places
